# Glass Activity Workflow Test Report

**Generated**: 2025-08-05T05:54:06.299Z  
**Test Type**: API Workflow Testing  
**Success Rate**: 0% (0/2 tests passed)

## Test Overview

This test verifies that activity tracking workflows are functioning properly by testing the Glass backend API endpoints.

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Details |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| API Connection | ❌ FAILED | Backend API accessibility |
| Activity Endpoints | ❌ FAILED | Timeline, metrics, status endpoints |
| Database Queries | ❌ FAILED | Data retrieval operations |
| Session Endpoints | ❌ FAILED | Ask/Listen session data |

## Detailed Test Log

**2025-08-05T05:54:06.291Z** 🧪 Starting Glass Activity Workflow Tests...
**2025-08-05T05:54:06.292Z** 🧪 Testing API connection...
**2025-08-05T05:54:06.299Z** ❌ API connection error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:54322
**2025-08-05T05:54:06.299Z** ❌ Cannot proceed without API connection

## Key Findings

### Database Connectivity
- ❌ Database may not be accessible or contains no data

### Activity Tracking System
- ❌ Activity tracking endpoints may have issues

### Session Management
- ❌ Session management may have issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. 🚨 **Critical**: Review failed API endpoints and fix connectivity issues
2. 📊 Check database connection and ensure data is being stored
3. 🔧 Verify backend service configuration

### Monitoring Setup
1. **API Health**: Monitor all endpoint response times and error rates
2. **Database Performance**: Track query performance and data growth
3. **User Activity**: Monitor active tracking sessions and data volume

### Data Verification Tasks
1. **Manual Verification**: Use Glass UI to trigger activities and verify data storage
2. **Database Inspection**: Directly query SQLite database to confirm data integrity
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow testing from UI through to database

## Next Steps

1. 🧪 **Run Manual UI Tests**: Test activity tracking through the Glass interface
2. 🗄️ **Database Direct Access**: Verify data is actually being stored in SQLite
3. 📊 **Performance Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent activities
4. 🔧 **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
