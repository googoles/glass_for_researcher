# Capture & Analyze Function Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Capture & Analyze Button Not Working**
- **Problem**: The button in MoreActionsView was calling `activity:capture-screenshot` which only captured screenshots without analysis
- **Solution**: 
  - Added new IPC handler `activity:capture-and-analyze` in `featureBridge.js`
  - Added `performManualCapture()` method to ActivityService that combines capture + AI analysis
  - Updated MoreActionsView to call the new handler and show proper feedback

### 2. **Generate Summary Button Improvements**
- **Problem**: Generate Summary button had minimal user feedback
- **Solution**: Enhanced to show insights and recommendations in an alert dialog

## Files Modified

### `/src/bridge/featureBridge.js`
- Added `activity:capture-and-analyze` IPC handler
- Handler captures screenshot, analyzes with AI, stores data, and returns summary

### `/src/features/activity/activityService.js`
- Added `performManualCapture()` public method
- Method handles complete workflow: capture → analyze → store → return results
- Includes proper error handling and privacy mode support

### `/src/ui/settings/MoreActionsView.js`
- Updated `_handleCaptureAndAnalyze()` to call new IPC handler
- Added success/error feedback with alerts
- Enhanced `_handleGenerateSummary()` with better user feedback

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Capture & Analyze"** in More Actions dropdown
2. **MoreActionsView** calls `activity:capture-and-analyze` via IPC
3. **FeatureBridge** routes to ActivityService.performManualCapture()
4. **ActivityService** performs:
   - Screenshot capture using native APIs
   - AI analysis using Gemini (if configured)
   - Data storage (if not in privacy mode)
   - Activity tracking updates
5. **Result** returned with summary and analysis details
6. **UI** shows success message or error alert

## Testing

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Gemini API key is configured in settings
- Activity tracking should be enabled for best results

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the application: `npm start`
2. Click the three-dots menu in the header
3. Click "Capture & Analyze" button
4. Should see:
   - Button shows "Capturing..." during processing
   - Success: Console shows activity summary
   - Error: Alert shows specific error message
5. Test "Generate Summary" button for daily insights

### Expected Results
- **Success**: Console logs show captured activity details and category
- **No AI configured**: Clear error message about Gemini API key
- **Screenshot fails**: Specific error about screen capture permissions

### Debugging
- Check console logs for detailed error messages
- Verify Gemini API key in Settings → AI Models
- Ensure screen recording permissions are granted

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- **No AI configured**: Clear message about missing Gemini API key
- **Screenshot capture fails**: Platform-specific error messages
- **Analysis fails**: Fallback to basic capture without AI analysis
- **Storage fails**: Error logged but capture still returns results

## Privacy Mode
- When privacy mode is enabled, screenshots and detailed analysis are not stored
- Only aggregate statistics are maintained
- Manual captures still work but with limited data retention

## Performance Notes
- Screenshots are automatically resized for optimal processing
- AI analysis typically takes 2-5 seconds depending on API response time
- Results are cached in memory for quick access
- History is limited to last 100 captures to manage memory usage
