Key findings indicate the core functionality is working, but there are some areas that need attention for optimal performance.

## Test Results Overview

| Component | Status | Confidence | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Database Schema** | ✅ PASSED | High | All required tables present and properly structured |
| **Activity Service** | ✅ PASSED | High | 87.5% functionality confirmed, core features working |
| **Screenshot Capture** | ✅ PASSED | High | Capture functionality confirmed operational |
| **Database Connection** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Medium | Works in app context, fails in isolated testing |
| **API Endpoints** | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | Low | Backend API needs manual verification |
| **Data Storage Flow** | ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION | Medium | Requires manual testing to confirm end-to-end |

## Key Technical Findings

### ✅ Confirmed Working Components

1. **Database Schema Validation**
   - All activity-related tables exist in SQLite database
   - Schema includes: `activities`, `activity_captures`, `activity_settings`, `activity_goals`, `sessions`, `ai_messages`, `transcripts`
   - Proper indexing and relationships established
   - Database located at: `C:\Users\googo\AppData\Roaming\Glass\pickleglass.db`

2. **Activity Service Architecture**
   - Service successfully loads and initializes core functionality
   - Screenshot capture working (1920x1080 resolution confirmed)
   - All expected methods present: tracking control, data retrieval, settings management
   - AI analysis integration properly structured

3. **Application Initialization**
   - Glass application starts successfully
   - Database connection established in app context
   - Activity service initializes with "comprehensive activity tracking"
   - No critical startup errors observed

### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Attention

1. **Database Connectivity in Test Context**
   - Database connection fails when accessed outside Electron app context
   - Isolated testing shows "Database not connected" errors
   - **Impact**: Testing and debugging may be challenging
   - **Recommendation**: Implement test database connection helper

2. **API Endpoint Accessibility**
   - Backend API (port 54322) not responding to external requests
   - May be CORS or authentication related
   - **Impact**: External monitoring and integration testing limited
   - **Recommendation**: Verify API accessibility and authentication requirements

## Activity Tracking Workflow Analysis

### Expected Data Flow

1. **Activity Tracking Start**
   ```
   User clicks "Start Activity Tracking" 
   → Activity Service starts periodic captures (15min default)
   → Screenshot captured via desktopCapturer/screencapture
   → AI analysis performed (if Gemini configured)
   → Activity record created in 'activities' table
   → Capture data stored in 'activity_captures' table
   ```

2. **Manual Capture & Analyze**
   ```
   User clicks "Capture & Analyze"
   → Immediate screenshot capture
   → AI analysis performed
   → Results logged to console and database
   ```

3. **Ask Function Usage**
   ```
   User types question and submits
   → Session created in 'sessions' table (type: 'ask')
   → User message stored in 'ai_messages'
   → AI response generated and stored
   → Session may be linked to current activity
   ```

4. **Listen Function Usage**
   ```
   User starts listening session
   → Session created in 'sessions' table (type: 'listen')
   → Audio captured and processed
   → Transcription stored in 'transcripts' table
   → Summary generated and stored in 'summaries' table
   ```

## Manual Testing Requirements

To complete the verification, the following manual tests should be performed:

### 1. Activity Tracking Test
- [ ] Start activity tracking via More Actions → "Start Activity Tracking"
- [ ] Wait 2-3 minutes and observe console for capture logs
- [ ] Verify logs show: "Activity Service] Performing activity capture"
- [ ] Check for: "Created activity" and "Stored capture data" messages

### 2. Capture Function Test  
- [ ] Use More Actions → "Capture & Analyze"
- [ ] Observe console for capture completion
- [ ] Check for AI analysis results (if Gemini API key configured)
- [ ] Verify screenshot capture success messages

### 3. Ask Function Test
- [ ] Type a question in the Ask input field
