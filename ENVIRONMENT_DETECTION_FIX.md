# Environment Detection and Activity Tracking Fix

## Overview

This fix addresses the issues with Start Tracking functionality and more-actions buttons by implementing proper environment detection to distinguish between Electron desktop app and web browser environments.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Start Tracking Function
- **Problem**: Activity tracking was accessible in web interface where it shouldn't work
- **Solution**: Added environment detection to show activity tracking only in Electron desktop app

### 2. More-actions Buttons Not Working
- **Problem**: Button handlers in Electron app had insufficient error handling and user feedback
- **Solution**: Enhanced all button handlers with proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Detection Utility (`/pickleglass_web/utils/environment.ts`)

**New Functions:**
- `isElectronEnvironment()` - Detects if running in Electron
- `isWebEnvironment()` - Detects if running in web browser
- `isActivityTrackingAvailable()` - Checks if activity tracking is available
- `getEnvironmentFeatures()` - Returns available features by environment
- `isIPCBridgeAvailable()` - Checks if Electron IPC is available

**Detection Methods:**
- Checks for `window.process.type` (Electron-specific)
- Checks for `window.electronAPI` 
- Checks for `window.require` (Electron Node.js integration)
- Checks user agent for 'electron' string

### 2. Research Page Updates (`/pickleglass_web/app/research/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added environment detection import and state
- Conditional rendering of activity tracking controls
- Shows "Desktop App Required" message in web environment
- Prevents API calls that would fail in web environment
- Added download link for desktop app

**UI Improvements:**
```tsx
{environmentFeatures.activityTracking ? (
  // Show tracking controls
) : (
  // Show desktop app required message
)}
```

### 3. Activity Page Updates (`/pickleglass_web/app/activity/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added environment detection
- Enhanced empty state with environment-specific messages
- Added desktop app download prompt for web users
- Better user guidance based on environment

### 4. Electron MoreActionsView Improvements (`/src/ui/settings/MoreActionsView.js`)

**Enhanced Button Handlers:**

#### Activity Tracking Toggle
- Added proper success/error checking
- Enhanced user feedback with specific error messages
- Added environment validation

#### Capture & Analyze
- Improved loading state management with `requestUpdate()`
- Enhanced success feedback with detailed analysis results
- Better error handling and user messages
- Shows productivity score, category, and summary

#### Generate Summary
- Enhanced summary formatting
- Added comprehensive data display (insights, recommendations, productivity score)
- Better fallback messages when no data available
- Improved error handling

#### Close Button
- Added try-catch error handling
- Added fallback methods for window hiding
- More robust window management

## Environment-Specific Features

### Electron Desktop App
- ✅ Activity tracking (start/stop)
- ✅ Screen capture and analysis
- ✅ Real-time productivity scoring
- ✅ AI-powered insights generation
- ✅ File system access
- ✅ System notifications
- ✅ IPC communication

### Web Browser
- ❌ Activity tracking (requires desktop app)
- ❌ Screen capture (requires desktop app)
- ✅ Project management
- ✅ Zotero integration
- ✅ Research organization
- ✅ Cloud data sync
- ✅ Cross-device access

## User Experience Improvements

### In Web Browser
- Clear messaging about desktop app requirements
- Direct download links to desktop app
- Explanation of desktop-only features
- Graceful degradation of functionality

### In Electron App
- Improved error messages for failed operations
- Better loading states with visual feedback
- Comprehensive success messages with details
- Enhanced button reliability

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all fixes:
```bash
node test-environment-detection.js
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Environment detection utility functions
- Research page conditional rendering
- Activity page environment handling
- Electron MoreActionsView improvements
- TypeScript compilation

## Expected Behavior

### Web Environment
- Activity tracking controls are hidden
- Users see "Desktop App Required" messages
- Download links are provided
- No failed API calls to desktop-only features

### Electron Environment
- All activity tracking features available
- Improved button reliability and feedback
- Better error handling and user messages
- Enhanced loading states

## Technical Implementation

### Environment Detection Logic
```typescript
export function isElectronEnvironment(): boolean {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return false;
  
  return !!(
    (window as any).process?.type ||
    (window as any).electronAPI ||
    (window as any).require ||
    navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().includes('electron')
  );
}
```

### Conditional Feature Rendering
```tsx
const environmentFeatures = getEnvironmentFeatures();

{environmentFeatures.activityTracking ? (
  <ActivityTrackingControls />
) : (
  <DesktopAppRequiredMessage />
)}
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
```javascript
async _handleActivityTrackingToggle() {
  try {
    if (window.api) {
      const result = await window.api.invoke('activity:start-tracking');
      if (result && result.success) {
        // Success handling with user feedback
      } else {
        // Error handling with specific messages
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Comprehensive error handling
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Clear guidance based on environment
2. **Reduced Confusion**: No broken features in web interface
3. **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling in desktop app
4. **Proper Separation**: Clear distinction between web and desktop features
5. **Enhanced Feedback**: Users know what's happening with their actions

## Files Modified

- `/pickleglass_web/utils/environment.ts` (new)
- `/pickleglass_web/app/research/page.tsx`
- `/pickleglass_web/app/activity/page.tsx`
- `/src/ui/settings/MoreActionsView.js`
- `/test-environment-detection.js` (new)

This fix ensures that activity tracking works properly only where it should (Electron app) and provides a smooth experience for web users with appropriate guidance toward the desktop app.
